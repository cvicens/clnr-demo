# clnr-demo
Initial demo of a data streaming application using the CLNR dataset.

This demo will show a number of containers processing data streams of smart meter readings. The data was generated by the [Customer Led Network Revoultion](http://www.networkrevolution.co.uk/project-data-download/?dl=TC1a.zip#) project. Initially the demo will use the TC1a dataset which has domestic smart meter readings on 30 minute intervals.
